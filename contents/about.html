    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my world of creativity and innovation!</p>
    <p>I'm Sneha Maity, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at Haldia Institute of Technology, where I explore the limitless possibilities of the digital realm. With a keen eye for design and a love for coding, I'm on a journey to craft beautiful and functional web experiences that leave a lasting impression.</p>
    <p>My quest for knowledge in the fields of Web Development and UI/UX design has led me to create this portfolio, where you'll find a collection of my projects and endeavors. Each line of code and pixel placed in my designs represents my dedication to bringing ideas to life.</p>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you can find me experimenting with new design trends, capturing moments through my camera lens, or exploring the vibrant world of art and culture.</p>
    <p>Join me on this exciting journey of creating digital magic. Let's connect, collaborate, and innovate together!</p>
